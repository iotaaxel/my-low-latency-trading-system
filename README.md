# My Low Latency Trading System

A user-friendly low-latency trading system in C++23 or C++26 that includes features liked by users of the Binance and Kraken platforms. The system should follow New York compliance regulations.

## Option 1:

### Overview

Designing a full-fledged trading system is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of trading platforms, compliance regulations, and software development. Here's a high-level outline of how you could approach this task in C++23 or C++26:

1. Compliance with New York Regulations: Familiarize yourself with the regulations and guidelines set by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) for virtual currency businesses. This includes implementing Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, as well as adhering to cybersecurity and data protection standards.

2. User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate the platform, view market data, place trades, and manage their accounts. This could be a web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or a desktop application using a GUI framework like Qt or wxWidgets.

3. Market Data Feed: Integrate a market data feed that provides real-time data on cryptocurrency prices, order books, and trade volumes. This could involve connecting to APIs provided by Binance and Kraken, or using a third-party data provider.

4. Order Management System: Develop an order management system that allows users to place, cancel, and modify orders. This system should be able to handle multiple order types (e.g., market orders, limit orders, stop-loss orders), and should be designed to minimize latency and ensure accurate order execution.

5. Risk Management: Implement risk management features to protect users from excessive losses. This could include features like position sizing, stop-loss orders, and margin calls.

6. Security: Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. This includes encrypting sensitive data, implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, and using secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS).

7. Scalability and Performance: Design the system to handle high volumes of traffic and trades, with minimal latency and downtime. This could involve using distributed systems, load balancing, and caching.

8. Testing and Quality Assurance: Thoroughly test the system to ensure it is stable, secure, and functions as expected. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.


Here's a simple example of how you might implement a basic trading system in C++23:

This is a very basic example and real-world trading systems are much more complex. They involve many more features, such as multiple order types, risk management, market data feeds, and more. They also require a deep understanding of trading platforms, compliance regulations, and software development.

Remember, designing a full-fledged trading system is a complex task that requires significant expertise and resources. It's not a project for beginners, and it's not something that can be accomplished in a short amount of time.

## Follow-up
### Potential Code Review Prompt: 
Optimize the code to reduce latency by minimizing lock contentions and improving execution speed. Add functionality to track and limit the maximum exposure per account, and implement stop-loss mechanisms. Additionally, if possible, add risk management tracking.

#### Feedback: 
1. Provide specific areas or methods to optimize.
2. Specify how you want the tracking and limiting to be implemented.
3. Clarify what kind of risk management tracking you need.
4. Consider connecting to an API or database.
5. 

### Option 1 Revised:
In this optimized version:

We use an unordered_map instead of a map for faster lookups.
We've added the exposure field to the Account class to track the current exposure per account.
We've added the maxExposure field to the Account class to set the maximum allowed exposure per account.
We've added the stopLoss field to the Account class to set the stop-loss percentage.
In the placeTrade method, we check if the trade exceeds the maximum allowed exposure and trigger the stop-loss mechanism if necessary.
We've also added basic risk management tracking by updating the exposure field after each trade.
Note that this is a simplified example and you may want to add more features and complexity to a real-world trading system.

### Option 2 Revised:
In this optimized version:

We use std::atomic<double> for balance and exposure in the Account class to minimize lock contentions when updating these values.
We add maxExposure and stopLoss to the Account class to track and limit the maximum exposure per account and implement stop-loss mechanisms.
We add a getRiskManagementMetrics function to the TradingSystem class to track risk management metrics, such as risk exposure.
We use a std::lock_guard to ensure thread-safe access to the accounts map.
We check if a trade exceeds the maximum exposure before executing it.
We check if the stop-loss is triggered after executing a trade and close all positions and disable trading for the account if it is.
Note that this is a simplified example and may not cover all the complexities of a real-world trading system. You may need to add additional functionality and risk management metrics depending on your specific requirements.


### Option 1 Thread-Safe:

To ensure that the code is thread-safe and scalable, you can consider the following improvements:

1. Use a thread-safe map:
  The std::map is not thread-safe by default. You can use a thread-safe map like std::unordered_map with a mutex or a lock-free map implementation.
2. Use a read-write lock:
  Instead of using a std::mutex which locks the entire map for both read and write operations, consider using a read-write lock like std::shared_mutex. This allows multiple threads to read simultaneously while preventing writes.
3. Use a concurrent queue for trades:
   Instead of processing trades directly in the placeTrade function, consider using a concurrent queue to store trades and process them in a separate thread. This decouples the trade processing from the main thread and improves responsiveness.
5. Use a thread pool for risk management metrics:
   Instead of calculating risk management metrics in the getRiskManagementMetrics function, consider using a thread pool to calculate metrics in parallel. This improves responsiveness and scalability.
6. Avoid locking the entire map for individual account operations: 
Instead of locking the entire map for individual account operations, consider using a lock striping approach. This involves dividing the map into smaller segments and locking only the relevant segment for each account operation.

This updated version uses a std::unordered_map with a std::shared_mutex for thread-safe access, a concurrent queue for trades, and a separate thread for processing trades. It also uses a thread pool for calculating risk management metrics. Additionally, it uses lock striping to lock only the relevant segment of the map for individual account operations.

### Option 2 Thread-Safe:

To ensure the code is thread-safe and scalable, you can use a combination of mutexes and atomic variables to protect shared data. 

In this updated version:

We use a std::shared_mutex instead of a std::mutex to allow for shared locking, which can improve performance in read-heavy scenarios.
We use std::unique_lock for exclusive locking and std::shared_lock for shared locking.
We make the mtx member variable mutable to allow for shared locking in getRiskManagementMetrics.
We use atomic variables for balance and exposure to ensure thread-safe updates.
This updated version should provide better thread safety and scalability. However, keep in mind that this is still a simplified example and may not cover all the complexities of a real-world trading system. You may need to add additional functionality and risk management metrics depending on your specific requirements.


### Option 1 Memory Safety and Race conditions

The code has several issues:

Memory Leak: The tradeProcessingThread is not joined in the destructor of TradingSystem class. This can lead to a memory leak if the TradingSystem object is destroyed before the thread is joined.

Race Condition: The tradeQueue is accessed by multiple threads without proper synchronization. This can lead to a race condition where the tradeQueue is accessed simultaneously by multiple threads, resulting in undefined behavior.

Scalability: The TradingSystem class uses a single thread to process trades for all accounts. This can lead to a bottleneck if the number of accounts is large. A more scalable approach would be to use a thread pool to process trades in parallel.

Robustness: The TradingSystem class does not handle exceptions properly. If an exception occurs in the processTrades method, it can lead to the termination of the trade processing thread. This can result in trades not being processed and the system being left in an inconsistent state.

This code fixes the memory leak by joining the tradeProcessingThread in the destructor of TradingSystem. It also fixes the race condition by using a condition variable to synchronize access to the tradeQueue. Additionally, it improves the scalability by using a separate thread to process trades, and it improves the robustness by handling exceptions properly.

### Option 2 Memory Safety and Race conditions

The given code has several issues that can be improved for better scalability, robustness, and to avoid potential memory leaks and race conditions:

In the placeTrade function, the tradeQueue is accessed without proper synchronization. This can lead to a race condition when multiple threads are placing trades simultaneously. To fix this, a mutex can be used to protect access to the tradeQueue.

In the processTrades function, the tradeQueue is accessed without proper synchronization. This can lead to a race condition when multiple threads are processing trades simultaneously. To fix this, a mutex can be used to protect access to the tradeQueue.

In the processTrades function, the accounts map is accessed without proper synchronization. This can lead to a race condition when multiple threads are accessing accounts simultaneously. To fix this, a mutex can be used to protect access to the accounts map.

In the getRiskManagementMetrics function, the accounts map is accessed without proper synchronization. This can lead to a race condition when multiple threads are accessing accounts simultaneously. To fix this, a mutex can be used to protect access to the accounts map.

The tradeProcessingThread is not properly joined in the destructor of the TradingSystem class. This can lead to a resource leak if the TradingSystem object is destroyed before the thread is joined. To fix this, the tradeProcessingThread should be joined in the destructor.

This improved code uses a std::mutex to protect access to the tradeQueue and a std::condition_variable to notify the trade processing thread when a new trade is added to the queue. The trade processing thread uses a std::unique_lock to wait for new trades and a std::shared_lock to access the accounts map. The getRiskManagementMetrics function also uses a std::shared_lock to access the accounts map. The destructor of the TradingSystem class properly joins the trade processing thread to prevent resource leaks.


### Concurrency-related prompt
This trading system should create low-latency trades on a per-user basis. Debug the code to identify any concurrency issues and improve the trading system's security features. The following code creates an account, places a trade, and reports risk management metrics.

### Option 1 Concurrency

The provided code has a few concurrency issues and security concerns:

Concurrency Issue: In the placeTrade function, the tradeQueue is accessed after releasing the shared lock on the mtx mutex. This can lead to a race condition if multiple threads are placing trades simultaneously. To fix this, the trade should be added to the queue while holding the lock.

Concurrency Issue: In the processTrades function, the tradeQueue is accessed after releasing the unique lock on the cvMutex mutex. This can lead to a race condition if multiple threads are processing trades simultaneously. To fix this, the trade should be retrieved from the queue while holding the lock.

Security Concern: The processTrades function does not handle exceptions properly. If an exception occurs while processing a trade, it can lead to the trade being partially executed, resulting in an inconsistent state. To fix this, exceptions should be caught and handled properly.

Security Concern: The placeTrade function does not validate the trade parameters properly. For example, it does not check if the trade quantity is valid or if the trade symbol is valid. To fix this, proper validation should be performed before placing the trade.

This code fixes the concurrency issues by holding the lock while accessing the tradeQueue. It also improves the security features by handling exceptions properly and validating trade parameters.

### Option 2 Concurrency

The given code has several concurrency issues and security concerns. Here are some of the issues and their fixes:

Concurrency Issue 1: In the placeTrade function, a std::shared_lock is used to lock the mtx mutex. However, this lock does not provide exclusive access to the accounts map. If multiple threads try to place trades for the same account simultaneously, it can lead to a data race condition.

Fix: Replace the std::shared_lock with a std::unique_lock in the placeTrade function to ensure exclusive access to the accounts map.

Concurrency Issue 2: In the processTrades function, a trade is retrieved from the queue and then the lock on cvMutex is released. However, if an exception occurs after releasing the lock and before processing the trade, the trade will be lost.

Fix: Move the trade processing code inside the scope of the lock on cvMutex to ensure that the trade is not lost in case of an exception.

Security Concern 1: The accounts map stores sensitive information such as account balances and exposure. However, this information is not encrypted or protected in any way.

Fix: Use a secure data storage mechanism, such as an encrypted database, to store sensitive account information.

Security Concern 2: The placeTrade function does not validate the trade parameters before placing the trade. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as arbitrary code execution or data corruption.

Fix: Validate the trade parameters thoroughly before placing the trade. For example, check that the trade quantity and price are within valid ranges.

Security Concern 3: The getRiskManagementMetrics function does not authenticate or authorize the user before providing sensitive risk management metrics.

Fix: Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive risk management metrics.

### Javascript (option 1)

Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for the given C++ trading system, using Node.js to handle concurrency and asynchronous operations. This code utilizes Map for accounts storage, Worker Threads for trade processing, and Mutex for thread-safe operations. Note that JavaScript lacks built-in atomic operations, so we use a custom locking mechanism for thread safety.

```
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');
const { Mutex } = require('async-mutex');

// Simple class to represent a user's account
class Account {
  constructor(username, balance, maxExposure, stopLoss) {
    this.username = username;
    this.balance = balance;
    this.exposure = 0.0;
    this.maxExposure = maxExposure;
    this.stopLoss = stopLoss;
  }
}

// Simple class to represent a trade
class Trade {
  constructor(symbol, price, quantity) {
    this.symbol = symbol;
    this.price = price;
    this.quantity = quantity;
  }
}

// Simple trading system class
class TradingSystem {
  constructor() {
    this.accounts = new Map();
    this.tradeQueue = [];
    this.tradeMutex = new Mutex();
    this.stopTradeProcessing = false;
    this.startTradeProcessing();
  }

  // Add a new account to the system
  addAccount(account) {
    this.accounts.set(account.username, account);
  }

  // Place a trade
  placeTrade(trade, username) {
    if (this.accounts.has(username)) {
      this.tradeQueue.push({ trade, username });
    } else {
      console.log("Account not found");
    }
  }

  // Process trades in a separate thread
  startTradeProcessing() {
    if (isMainThread) {
      const worker = new Worker(__filename, { workerData: null });
      worker.on('message', () => {
        this.processTrades();
      });
      worker.on('exit', () => {
        if (this.stopTradeProcessing) {
          worker.terminate();
        } else {
          this.startTradeProcessing();
        }
      });
    }
  }

  async processTrades() {
    while (!this.stopTradeProcessing) {
      await this.tradeMutex.runExclusive(async () => {
        if (this.tradeQueue.length > 0) {
          const { trade, username } = this.tradeQueue.shift();
          const account = this.accounts.get(username);

          if (account) {
            // Check if the user has sufficient balance to place the trade
            if (account.balance >= trade.price * trade.quantity) {
              // Check if the trade exceeds the maximum exposure
              if (account.exposure + trade.price * trade.quantity <= account.maxExposure) {
                // Simulate trade execution
                console.log(`Trade executed: ${trade.symbol} ${trade.quantity} @ ${trade.price}`);
                account.balance -= trade.price * trade.quantity;
                account.exposure += trade.price * trade.quantity;

                // Check if stop-loss is triggered
                if (account.balance <= account.stopLoss) {
                  console.log(`Stop-loss triggered for account ${username}`);
                  // Close all positions and disable trading for this account
                  account.exposure = 0.0;
                }
              } else {
                console.log("Trade exceeds maximum exposure");
              }
            } else {
              console.log("Insufficient balance to place trade");
            }
          } else {
            console.log("Account not found");
          }
        }
      });

      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10));
    }
  }

  // Get the current risk management metrics
  getRiskManagementMetrics(username) {
    const account = this.accounts.get(username);
    if (account) {
      const riskExposure = account.exposure / account.maxExposure;
      console.log(`Risk exposure for account ${username}: ${riskExposure}`);
    } else {
      console.log("Account not found");
    }
  }
}

if (isMainThread) {
  // Main thread: create trading system, add accounts, place trades, and get metrics
  const tradingSystem = new TradingSystem();

  // Create a new account
  const account = new Account('user1', 1000.0, 5000.0, 500.0);
  tradingSystem.addAccount(account);

  // Place a trade
  const trade = new Trade('BTCUSD', 50000.0, 0.1);
  tradingSystem.placeTrade(trade, 'user1');

  // Get the current risk management metrics
  setTimeout(() => {
    tradingSystem.getRiskManagementMetrics('user1');
  }, 1000);
} else {
  // Worker thread: listen for messages to process trades
  parentPort.postMessage('ready');
}
```
This code uses the Worker class from worker_threads to handle the trade processing in a separate thread. A Mutex from the async-mutex package ensures that the critical section of processing trades is thread-safe. The main thread initializes the trading system, adds an account, places a trade, and retrieves risk management metrics.
