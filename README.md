A user-friendly low-latency trading system in C++23 or C++26 that includes features liked by users of the Binance and Kraken platforms. The system should follow New York compliance regulations.

## Option 1:

### Overview

Designing a full-fledged trading system is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of trading platforms, compliance regulations, and software development. Here's a high-level outline of how you could approach this task in C++23 or C++26:

1. Compliance with New York Regulations: Familiarize yourself with the regulations and guidelines set by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) for virtual currency businesses. This includes implementing Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, as well as adhering to cybersecurity and data protection standards.

2. User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate the platform, view market data, place trades, and manage their accounts. This could be a web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or a desktop application using a GUI framework like Qt or wxWidgets.

3. Market Data Feed: Integrate a market data feed that provides real-time data on cryptocurrency prices, order books, and trade volumes. This could involve connecting to APIs provided by Binance and Kraken, or using a third-party data provider.

4. Order Management System: Develop an order management system that allows users to place, cancel, and modify orders. This system should be able to handle multiple order types (e.g., market orders, limit orders, stop-loss orders), and should be designed to minimize latency and ensure accurate order execution.

5. Risk Management: Implement risk management features to protect users from excessive losses. This could include features like position sizing, stop-loss orders, and margin calls.

6. Security: Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. This includes encrypting sensitive data, implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, and using secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS).

7. Scalability and Performance: Design the system to handle high volumes of traffic and trades, with minimal latency and downtime. This could involve using distributed systems, load balancing, and caching.

8. Testing and Quality Assurance: Thoroughly test the system to ensure it is stable, secure, and functions as expected. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.


Here's a simple example of how you might implement a basic trading system in C++23:

This is a very basic example and real-world trading systems are much more complex. They involve many more features, such as multiple order types, risk management, market data feeds, and more. They also require a deep understanding of trading platforms, compliance regulations, and software development.

Remember, designing a full-fledged trading system is a complex task that requires significant expertise and resources. It's not a project for beginners, and it's not something that can be accomplished in a short amount of time.

### Overview
Here's a basic outline of how you could design a low-latency trading system in C++23/C++26 that includes features liked by users of Binance and Kraken platforms, while following New York compliance regulations. This is a high-level overview and actual implementation would require a significant amount of code and infrastructure.


System Components:

Trading Engine: This is the core component of the system, responsible for executing trades, managing orders, and maintaining the order book. It should be designed to be highly performant and scalable.

Market Data Feed: This component is responsible for receiving and processing market data from various exchanges. It should be designed to handle high volumes of data and provide low-latency updates to the trading engine.

User Interface: This component provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system. It should include features such as real-time market data, order management, and account management.

Risk Management: This component is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the system operates within regulatory requirements. It should include features such as position limits, margin requirements, and anti-money laundering checks.

Compliance: This component is responsible for ensuring that the system operates in compliance with New York regulations. It should include features such as trade reporting, record keeping, and customer identification.


Key Features:

Low-Latency Trading: The system should be designed to provide low-latency trading, with the ability to execute trades in microseconds.

Real-Time Market Data: The system should provide real-time market data, including prices, volumes, and order book depth.

Advanced Order Types: The system should support advanced order types, such as limit orders, stop-loss orders, and take-profit orders.

Risk Management: The system should include robust risk management features, including position limits, margin requirements, and anti-money laundering checks.

User-Friendly Interface: The system should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to use and provides a seamless trading experience.

Mobile Trading: The system should include a mobile trading app that allows users to trade on-the-go.

API: The system should include a robust API that allows developers to integrate the trading system with other applications.


C++23/C++26 Features:

Coroutines: C++23/C++26 provides support for coroutines, which can be used to improve the performance and scalability of the trading engine.

Parallelism: C++23/C++26 provides support for parallelism, which can be used to improve the performance of the market data feed and risk management components.

Modules: C++23/C++26 provides support for modules, which can be used to improve the organization and maintainability of the codebase.

Ranges: C++23/C++26 provides support for ranges, which can be used to improve the performance and readability of the code.


New York Compliance Regulations:

Trade Reporting: The system should be designed to report trades to the relevant regulatory authorities in a timely and accurate manner.

Record Keeping: The system should be designed to maintain accurate and complete records of all trades, including the date, time, price, and quantity of each trade.

Customer Identification: The system should be designed to verify the identity of all customers and ensure that they are eligible to trade.

Anti-Money Laundering: The system should be designed to detect and prevent money laundering activities.

Cybersecurity: The system should be designed to protect against cyber threats and ensure the security of customer data.


## Follow-up
### Potential Code Review Prompt: 
Optimize the code to reduce latency by minimizing lock contentions and improving execution speed. Add functionality to track and limit the maximum exposure per account, and implement stop-loss mechanisms. Additionally, if possible, add risk management tracking.

#### Feedback: 
1. Provide specific areas or methods to optimize.
2. Specify how you want the tracking and limiting to be implemented.
3. Clarify what kind of risk management tracking you need.
4. Consider connecting to an API or database.
5. 

### Option 1 Revised:
In this optimized version:

We use an unordered_map instead of a map for faster lookups.
We've added the exposure field to the Account class to track the current exposure per account.
We've added the maxExposure field to the Account class to set the maximum allowed exposure per account.
We've added the stopLoss field to the Account class to set the stop-loss percentage.
In the placeTrade method, we check if the trade exceeds the maximum allowed exposure and trigger the stop-loss mechanism if necessary.
We've also added basic risk management tracking by updating the exposure field after each trade.
Note that this is a simplified example and you may want to add more features and complexity to a real-world trading system.

### Option 2 Revised:
In this optimized version:

We use std::atomic<double> for balance and exposure in the Account class to minimize lock contentions when updating these values.
We add maxExposure and stopLoss to the Account class to track and limit the maximum exposure per account and implement stop-loss mechanisms.
We add a getRiskManagementMetrics function to the TradingSystem class to track risk management metrics, such as risk exposure.
We use a std::lock_guard to ensure thread-safe access to the accounts map.
We check if a trade exceeds the maximum exposure before executing it.
We check if the stop-loss is triggered after executing a trade and close all positions and disable trading for the account if it is.
Note that this is a simplified example and may not cover all the complexities of a real-world trading system. You may need to add additional functionality and risk management metrics depending on your specific requirements.
